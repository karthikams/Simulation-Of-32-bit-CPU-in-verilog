# Simulation-Of-32-bit-CPU-in-verilog
# Implemented a 5-stage pipelined 32-bit RISC CPU. Project development involved module creation for Program Counter, Instruction Memory and Register, Register File, ALU and Data Memory.
# Implemented Register to register, immediate and data movement type fixed point instructions.	Incorporated ADDF and MULF floating point instructions in CPU.
# Additional functionality to overcome data and control hazards.
